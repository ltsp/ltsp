# break:mount, /scripts/local, /scripts/nfs, break:mountroot,

# break:init, run-init.
# Another way to hook would be rdinit=.

# Notes:
# It needs the .conf extension, it can't be .sh.
# Don't exit from here! It's sourced! (bad shebang is for gedit highlighting)
# Use functions and local variables, to avoid namespace pollution
