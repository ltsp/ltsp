# The special [server] section is evaluated only by the ltsp server

# Enable NAT on dual NIC servers
# NAT=1
# Provide a full menu name for x86_32.img when `ltsp ipxe` runs

# The special [common] section is evaluated by both the server and ltsp clients
[common]
# Specify an alternative TFTP_DIR
# TFTP_DIR=/var/lib/tftpboot

# In the special [clients] section, parameters for all clients can be defined.
# Most ltsp.conf parameters should be placed here.

# Specify an /etc/fstab line for NFS home; note this is insecure
# FSTAB_NFS="server:/home /home nfs defaults,nolock 0 0"
# Specify a CMDLINE_BOOT_METHOD for alternative boot methodes like RBD or iSCSI.
# Here is an example RBD boot cmdline:
# It follows this form: rbdroot=<mons>:<user>:<key>:<pool>:<image>[@<snapshot>]:[<partition>]:[<mountopts>]
# Be aware that user is the username part only not "client.username" as often
# referred to in Ceph. If the MON services listen on a non-standard port, port
# shall be specified with ";" instead of standard ":" for obvious reasons -
# e.g. host;7000
