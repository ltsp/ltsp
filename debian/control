Description: Linux Terminal Server Project
 Make an installation able to netboot as an LTSP client.
 For LTSP servers, also install the suggested packages (dnsmasq etc).
 .
 LTSP helps in netbooting LAN clients from a single installation that resides
 in a chroot or a VM on the LTSP server. This way maintaining tens or hundreds
 of clients is as easy as maintaining a single PC.
